## Projects
### Healthcare and Bioinformatics Data Analysis
This portfolio features projects where I used Python and SQL to clean, transform, and analyze datasets in healthcare, bioinformatics, and finance. The projects include analyzing the impact of nutraceuticals on lifespan (DrugAge), cancer research trends, longevity gene variants, Covid testing patterns, and liquor store sales. The code and datasets can be found on the project's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/PanosChatzi/Healthcare_and_Bioinformatics_Analyses).

Programming languages and libraries: MySQL, Python, pandas, seaborn, plotly

### Physiological Data Analysis and Statistics
This project accompanies our scientific paper, "Erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism affects muscle oxygenation and exercise performance: a randomized double-blind crossover study in humans". It features data preparation, visualization, and statistical analysis scripts. The statistical analyses include custom scripts for linear models, repeated measures ANOVA, post-hoc tests, and effect size calculations. All code and datasets are available on the project's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/PanosChatzi/erythrocyte_study_statistical_analyses).

Programming languages and libraries: R, tidyverse, afex, lme4, emmeans, multcomp
